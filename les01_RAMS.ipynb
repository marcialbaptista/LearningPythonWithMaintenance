    "# AE4465 (MM&A) - Reliability, Availability, Maintenance and Supportability (RAMS) and its Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you are working for an airline. They provide you with data about their maintenance processes for different equipment (data/RAMS_data.csv). The first task the airline ask you to do is the KPIs of RAMS. KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) is a tool used in maintenance (and business in general) to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of various operations and strategies. KPIs are quantitive measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "KPIs are designed to be measurable, time-bound, specific, relevant, and attainable. Being measurable, they provide quantifiable data. Their time-bound nature means that they are set with specific deadlines. The specificity of KPIs ensures that they target particular aspects of performance. Their relevance is critical, as they must align with the organization's broader goals and objectives. Lastly, KPIs are set to be attainable, striking a balance between challenging and realistic. This combination of attributes ensures that KPIs are not just metrics, but strategic tools that guide and inform decision-making towards organizational success.\n",

    "The implementation of KPIs in maintenance are used to assess how maintenance can help to correct deficiencies and increase the performance of an airline.\n",
